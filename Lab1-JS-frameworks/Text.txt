Node.js is not a programming language; it is a runtime environment allowing you to execute JavaScript code on the server side, outside a web browser.
Built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome, Node.js compiles JavaScript into machine code for efficient execution.
It extends JavaScript capabilities by providing additional features and libraries for server-side development, such as file system access, network communication, and asynchronous I/O operations.

While JavaScript is the programming language used with Node.js, the runtime environment provides the tools and frameworks to build scalable and high-performance server applications.
Node.jsâ€™s non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it ideal for real-time applications, web servers, APIs, and more.
In summary, Node.js is a robust environment that leverages JavaScript to enable server-side programming, but it is not a programming language.
